## Introduction

When the application starts, the GPIO pins(P22, P23, P24) are configured as outputs to drive the RGB LED. The application then loops while toggling the state of one of the LEDs every 500 milliseconds.


## Compile & Program

```
$ make flash
```

Observe that the LEDs are blinking.
