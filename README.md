# nRF52832-MDK

*An Open Source, Micro Development Kit for IoT Embedded Applications*

[中文文档](https://wiki.makerdiary.co/nrf52832-mdk)

**nRF52832-MDK** is a fully open-source development kit based on [Nordic nRF52832](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF52832) for IoT embedded applications. 

It also includes an integrated debug adapter -- [DAPLink](https://github.com/mbedmicro/DAPLink/), which provides methods to program and debug your applications. This enables developers to quickly establish a Bluetooth connection and evaluate nRF52832 SoC.
